It is so profound and yet so simple. The warm-hearted nature and facilitation style of the trainers added much value to the training. It led me to seek Kabule to facilitate retreat in 'Joyshop' of 'Women's Cooperative Society Ltd. (WCS)' and 'Strategic Planning' of National Coalition Against Racial Discrimination (NCARD). The experience has been wonderful and thoroughly enjoyed by all the participants. I am amazed by how deep insights were realized in a playful way. Thanks R.
