            <p>
              We turn a “retreat” into “real treat”. Staff retreat can be a
              great opportunity to transform individuals and team effectiveness
              to higher levels of professional excellence. Our facilitation not
              only increases fun but also provides insightful learning. The
              changes can be felt in work, team building, and personal life —
              and they are enduring. So, this small investment will add great
              quality to your staff retreat and beyond.
            </p>

                “Now we are seeing the changes in our office – the result of
                the retreat you facilitated.”

                <br /><em>(after a month of 3-day retreat program facilitated by Kabule)</em>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                “It has been a wise decision choosing Kabule as Facilitator of
                the annual staff retreat program. All staffs were happy and
                thanked me for bringing Kabule as the Facilitator. Everyone was
                amazed how so many activities (indoor, outdoor games, exercises,
                reflections, meditation and relaxation) were possible in a short
                time. It has been both entertaining and useful for enhancing
                leadership quality and team work. It was full of fun and high
                level of learning.”

              <h3>Objectives</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>To fill staff retreat with fun and learning.</li>
                <li>To discover happiness, which is our intrinsic nature.</li>
                <li>
                  To make the team feel energized, refreshed, and relaxed; and
                  filled with renewed enthusiasm and motivation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To strengthen team spirit for better coordination and
                  co-operation among staff.
                </li>
                <li>To derive insightful learning from fun and play.</li>

            <div class="box">
              <h3>The Process and Contents</h3>
              <p>
                Learning happens more in fun than in a serious setting. That is
                why children learn more and faster than adults. Insights come
                when we are relaxed. Our experience has been that learning is
                intense during fun-filled retreats than in formal training
                programs.
              </p>
              <p>Our programs run simultaneously at four levels:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Body —</strong> Body is the foundation. We engage the
                  body through games, activities, and exercises in the funniest
                  manner so that we can be a child again. Only then we are
                  connected with our intrinsic nature, which is full of
                  playfulness, happiness, and openness. These are essential
                  prerequisites for insightful learning and higher intelligence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mind —</strong> Mind is always engaged in thinking.
                  But mostly our thinking is guided by certain patterns and
                  structures, which is why it becomes stressed. In the retreat
                  we experiment with out-of-box thinking to promote relaxation,
                  from where positive mindset and creative thinking is
                  developed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Heart —</strong> “The heart of the problem is the
                  problem of the heart.” In official settings we rarely talk
                  from and listen to the heart. Many problems that cannot be
                  solved by hard thinking can be solved in no time by
                  engagement of the heart. In retreats, we awaken the feeling
                  domain and promote heart-to-heart communication with oneself
                  and others.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spirit —</strong> We are ‘human beings’. But in
                  modern society we have forgotten that and have become ‘human
                  doing’. Being is our essence — the ‘life’ of our life.
                  Without it everything is nothing. That is why people feel
                  lifeless even when they have everything.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
              <h3>Possible Topics for Your Retreat</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Leadership and team building</li>
                <li>Communication and relation building</li>
                <li>Yoga, pranayam and physical exercises</li>
                <li>Meditation and spiritual intelligence</li>
                <li>Motivation and meaning</li>
                <li>Stress management</li>
                <li>Group therapies and healing</li>
                <li>Just fun without agenda</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The choices are open to you. You can select two or three topics
                from the list. We will design the program accordingly.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
              <h3>Format and Customization</h3>
              <p>
                The program will be a combination of indoor and outdoor
                activities. You can decide the proportion of indoor and outdoor
                activities as preferred. You may also like to allocate some
                hours for your team’s own engagements. Kabule will plan
                activities considering all these factors.
